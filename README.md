# Yao_et_al_2025_Irrigation-induced_land_water_depletion_aggravated_by_climate_change

This is the code developed for the manuscript 'Irrigation-induced land water depletion aggravated by climate change'

**irrigation_area_and_water_plotting.ipynb**

Calculating and plotting the time series of irrigated area and irrigation water withdrawal. Users need to download related datasets and change `BASE_DIR` in the code.

**water_bars_multi_models.ipynb**

Calculating and plotting the 19-year average precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration in four IPCC reference regions. Users need to download related datasets and change `str_base` in the code.

**water_map_plotting.ipynb**

Calculating the impacts of different forcings on precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, terrestrial water storage, and irrigation water withdrawal. Users need to download related datasets and change `BASE_DIR` in the code.

**water_timeseries_plotting.ipynb**

Calculating and plotting the time series of precipitation minus evapotranspiration, and terrestrial water storage. Users need to download related datasets and change `str_base` in the code.

**Datasets used in the analysis and visualisation can be found:**
