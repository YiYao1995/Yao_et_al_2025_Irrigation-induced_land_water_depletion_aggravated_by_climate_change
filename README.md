# Yao_et_al_2025_Irrigation-induced_land_water_depletion_aggravated_by_climate_change
This is the code developed for the manuscript 'Irrigation-induced land water depletion aggravated by climate change'

cdo_code_NorESM_as_example.sh
This is the code used for calculating annual mean and multi-year mean values from the raw data of IRRMIP. In this code, the output of NorESM is used as example.

Water_bars_multi_models.ipynb
This is the Jupyter Notebook code used for calculate and plot 19-year mean precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff in different IPCC reference regions, which is presented in Figure 2 of the manuscript.

Water_map_plotting_all_models.ipynb
This is the Jupyter Notebook code used for calculate and plot maps of water variables, which are presented in Figure 1, 3 and A2.

Water_timeseries_all_models_minus_average_simplified.ipynb
This is the Jupyter Notebook code used for calculate and plot maps of water time-series, which are presented in Figure 4, 5 and A1.
